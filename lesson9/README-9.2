Configure security

- Commonly used but insecure
  - passphrase-less SSH keys to connect to remote hosts
  - become=true as std setting
  - passwordless priv escallation

- More secure but not convenient
  - -b -K when needed
    -b become when needed
    -K to enter sudo password

- Securing SSH connections
  - Use ssh-keygen to generate a key protected by a password
  - Use "eval ssh-agent $SHELL" to start the ssh agent after login
  - Use ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa to add you identity to the agent
  - Verify using ssh-add -l

- Put in .bashrc, etc to automate it
  if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]; then
    eval `ssh-agent -s`
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  fi
