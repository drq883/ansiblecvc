Configuring Managed Hosts with Ad-hoc Commands

cat <<HOSTS >inventory
ubuntu
ansible1
ansible2
freebs]
HOSTS

You should ssh once to each host to setup an entry in the known_hosts file

setup ubuntu user with a name ansible (ubuntu needs admin user, not root):

  ansible -i inventory ubuntu -m user -a "name=ansible create_home=yes" -u drq -b -k -K

for ansible1/2

  ansible -i inventory rocky -m user -a "name=ansible create_home=yes" -u root -k

for freebsd:

  ansible -i inventory freebsd -m user -a "name=ansible create_home=yes" -u root -k

for tower:

  ansible -i inventory tower -m user -a "name=ansible create_home=yes" -u root -k

Now let's set passwords for the user ansible:

  ansible -i inventory ubuntu -m shell -a "echo 'ansible:password' | chpasswd" -u student -b -k -K
  ansible -i inventory rocky -m shell -a "echo password | passwd --stdin ansible" -u root -k
  # had to manually set password on FreeBSD

Create a key-pair on control node and copy to hosts:

  ssh-keygen   /* press enter for all prompts */

  ssh-copy-id ubuntu
  ssh-copy-id ansible1
  ssh-copy-id ansible2
  ssh-copy-id freebsd

And test:

  ansible -i inventory all -m command -a "id" -u ansible
