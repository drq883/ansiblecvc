8 - using roles and collections

8.1 - understanding collections
- make thing more managable
- more than 3000 different modules
- different sources
- collections may contain the following:
  - modules
  - roles
  - plugins

- naming Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN) such as:
  - ansible.netcommon
- for modules:
  - ansible.netcommon.cli_command
  - ansible.builtin.user
- can add collection setting in play header to shorten use of modules
- examples:
  from ansiblecvc/collections

8.2 Understaning roles
- roles define common tasks for a type of host
- others publish roles in ansible-galaxy and you can
  refer to them in your playbooks
- only need to add site-specific change
- execution order
  - tasks in roles are executed before other task in playbook
  - use pre_tasks to execute tasks before the role
  - any hanlders triggered by pre_tass are also executed before role
  - example
    nginx-role.yml
    this failed:
    - ansible-galaxy role install geerlingguy.nginx

8.3 - Working with Galaxy
- galaxy.ansible.com is a community website for roles and collections
- ansible-galaxy role
- ansible-galaxy collection
