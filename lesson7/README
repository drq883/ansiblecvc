7.1 - Manipulate files
- ansible.builting.copy - copy files
  - files and directories
  - contents to copy a line of test to a new file

- ansible.posix.synchrnize (rsync)
  - rsync command
  - more efficient than copy
  - deletate_to to change source host other than localhost

- ansible.builting.fetch - copy files from managed host to control host
  - will store files by appending hostname/path/to/file to the fetched file
  - use the flat option to override the behavior

7.2 - Change File Contents
- ansible.builtin.copy
- ansible.builtin.replace - based on a regular expression
  - can be used for simple operations
  - ansible all -m copy -a "content=hello dest=/tmp/hellofile"
  - can use replace to update text or delete test

- ansible.builtin.lineinfile
  - add a single line to a file

- ansible.builtin.blockinfile
  - add multiple lines to a file

- examples:
  copy.yml

7.3 - Using the find Module
- similar to find on linux
- can be used with regexp, or in combination with lineinfile to perform mods to multiple files
- can use register with tind to build a playbook to change files regardless of their exact location
- examples:
  changeconfig.yaml

7.4 - Using Templates
- sample configuration file that is combined with env vars to produce site specific configuration files
- based on the jina2 templating language
- advanced templates allow conditional structures as well as loop structures
- examples:
