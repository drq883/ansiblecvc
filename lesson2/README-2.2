  Pre-2.10
    ansible-doc -l

  2.10 and later:
    ansible-doc -t module -l

ansible.builtin.command is the default module:

  ansible all -a "ls -a /root"

ansible.builtin.shell used if pipes are neccesary

ansible.builtint.raw will run with out the need for python
  ansible all -m raw -a "ls -a /root"

ansible.builtin.package for managing packages

ansible.builtin.user for managing users

ansible.builtin.service for managing services


Best Practices:

- Always use the most specific module you can find
  - don't always default to "command" or "shell"
- Using generic modules often leads to problems
  - might not do well with desired state 
- Idempotency - if current state matches, it will not fail
